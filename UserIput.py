# input() = A function that prompts the user to enter data 
#           Returns the entered data as a string

name = input("What is your name?: ")
age = int(input("How old are you?")) # you need to typecast because the input() function will take only in strings and we have to convert it into integer

age = age +1;

print(f"You are {age} year old")
print(f"Hello {name}!")
